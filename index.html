    <section id="love">
        <p>When I first saw you nearly three years ago I had major heart eyes for you almost instantly. You immediatly brought a huge smile to my face. You were gorgeous. You still are! I still look at you sometimes and cant believe youre mine and I cherish and value you so much. I sometimes dont know how to say what im feeling so I hope this will help show you how I feel about you.</p>
